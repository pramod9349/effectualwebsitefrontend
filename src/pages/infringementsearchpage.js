                              Organizations make significant investments in research and development and filing patents. We help our clients convert these investments into returns by enforcing the legal rights of their IP portfolio. 
				<br /><br />

                
        A patent comes with certain legal rights, one of them being able to monopolize your invention for a certain period (usually twenty years). One way to monetize patents is by conducting patent infringement searches. A patent infringement occurs when an organization knowingly or unknowingly incorporates the claimed elements of a granted patent into their product(s)/service(s). 

                <br /> <br />
                However, searching for these products or services isn’t as forward as it may seem because companies often advertise their products or services using so-called ‘marketing language’. Product advertisements and literature often skip out on technical terms and jargon to appeal and be understandable to a larger audience. Meanwhile, a patent is a techno-legal document that contains all sorts of technical and legal terms. A simple google search of the patent claims usually returns not highly relevant results. Infringement searches require in-depth knowledge of the patented subject matter domain, relevant product or services and the ability to relate ‘marketing language’ to the techno-legal language.
<br /><br />
Our team of domain experts at Effectual Services performs an in-depth analysis of patents and identifies the key application market areas for the invention. We identify companies active in the identified market and thoroughly search their products and services portfolio to identify infringing leads. Our techno-legal professionals are well versed in correlating ‘marketing’ language with technical terminologies.
  <br /><br />
  We also provide portfolio management and targeted infringement searches for maximum monetization. Our team analyzes and/or mines IP portfolios for our clients, identifies target markets and competitors, and scrutinizes competitors' product portfolios and financial records.
  <br /><br />
  We provide the deliverables as infringement feasibility reports and claim charts. A feasibility report includes infringement probability of a product or service along with a detailed summary of the analysis. The turnaround time for a feasibility report is eight hours. Further, the claim charts include detailed mapping of the product features against the patent claims with proper comments. The turnaround time for a claim chart is 12-14 Hours.

  <p class ="mb-4">One of our client, from telecommunication domain, requested us to help monetize their IP portfolio of large size against their key competitors. The requirement was to identify potential infringing products or services from the competitors which closely read the claims of the issued assets. <br></br><br></br>
  As a first step, we ran the provided Granted Patents from our client portfolio through our in-house ranking tool in order to determine their patent strength.  Our ranking tool is designed to determine the value of a patent based on 10 key parameters, for example forward citations, Litigation status, family legal status, geographical coverage, etc. The proprietary algorithm of the tool assigns different weights to the key parameters based upon one’s business context and assesses the strength of each patent accordingly. <br></br><br></br>
  Once the portfolio was ranked based on the key parameters, as a next step, we manually categorized the portfolio based on the prepared taxonomy. The taxonomy was earlier evolved by our technology experts using technology-specific keywords and patent classes. The result was a bucket of patents that were domain-specific and highly valued.
  <br></br><br></br>
  The next task was to identify potential targets from competitors' product and services portfolio. Our domain experts used their experience and in-depth knowledge of the products and services to derive keywords which were functionally equivalent to the claimed aspects of granted assets. Using this approach, we analyzed each competitor product thoroughly against all the categorized patents of our client and we gave them a moniker, 'H', 'M', or 'L' for high, medium, and low respectively, based on the infringement probability against each granted asset. Using this approach, we were able to identify a good number of potential infringing products from the vast and varying product portfolio of competitors and later we prepared claim charts for nearly 30% of the granted assets of our client. For the remaining 70% assets, we prepared feasibility reports describing our detailed technical findings in brief. 
  <br></br><br></br>
The client was highly impressed by our output and as a result we are still continuing to extend our services and support to fulfill their monetization and other IP business needs.
