							As the name suggests, Opposition is a process for opposing the patent. The Indian Patent Act 1970 provides two modes for opposition of a patent – pre-grant opposition or post grant opposition. In a pre-grant opposition, an interested party may oppose the grant of a patent application filed in India. On the other hand, a post-grant opposition is applicable for a patent that was recently granted. Indian Patent Act provides a variety of grounds which can form a basis for a pre/post grant opposition. The grounds for both pre and post-grant opposition are similar. Also, if a pre-grant opposition fails a person may file a post-grant opposition subsequently. However, there are procedural differences between the pre and post grant oppositions.
							
							<br />
							<br />

The main difference between a pre-grant opposition and post-grant opposition is that – a pre-grant opposition may filed by “any person”, but a post-grant opposition may only be filed by a “person interested”. “Person interested” is defined in Indian Patent Act 1970 as a person who is engaged in, or in promoting, research in the same field as that to which the invention relates. A pre/post grant opposition is one of the effective business strategies being used by many organizations in order to oppose the monopolistic position provided by the patent to the assignee.
