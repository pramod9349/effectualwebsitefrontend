                    <p class="lg:w-1/2 w-full leading-relaxed text-gray-500">Trademark includes any brand, logo, symbol, word or words, capable of distinguishing goods and services of one person from those of another. According to Section 2 (m) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, “the “mark” includes a device, brand, heading, label, ticket, name, signature, word, letter, numeral, shape of goods, packaging or combination of colours or any combination thereof”.

                      Trademarks are granted protection in India under Section 18 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, which states that “any person claiming to be the proprietor of a trade mark used or proposed to be used by him, who is desirous of registering it, shall apply in writing to the Registrar in the prescribed manner for the registration of his trade mark”.
                      
                      Also, one person can file a single trademark application with multiple classes of Goods and Services. Registration of Trademark shall give the monopoly right to the proprietor to use and exploit the brand/trademark, and protect the trademark from any kind of illegal usage by any third party user, by initiating an Infringement suit against such use.</p>
