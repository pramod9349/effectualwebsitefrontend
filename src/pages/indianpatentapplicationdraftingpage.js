							Generally, patent drafters are experts in drafting US patent, thanks to outsourcing. However, when it comes to drafting Indian patents things are not exactly the same. Even if we talk about the basic patent laws, US laws speak of what cannot be patented and Indian laws talk about what can be patented.
