                USPTO has procedures under which the examination of a patent application may be accelerated under certain circumstances. USPTO may advance the examination of an application out of turn for examination if the applicant files a petition to make the case special under the accelerated examination program. An applicant going though the accelerated route receives the examinerâ€™s final decision within 12 months, but has to provide additional information with their petition. The petition to be made special should include pre-examination search report that includes the search log with details like specific class, sub-class combination searched and a discussion on closest art with a focus on differentiating factors. We offer comprehensive searches in conformity with the USPTO accelerated examination guidelines.
