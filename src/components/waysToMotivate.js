                    The world has been brought down on its knees at the onset of
                    Covid-19 pandemic. Preventive actions for Covid-19 include
                    avoiding social gathering and maintaining social distance,
                    and thus complete or partial lockdown of nation.

                    The virus can be exceptionally contagious particularly in a
                    crowded office place, therefore worldwide companies have
                    triggered the alarm bell in corporate world. Due to such
                    preventive actions, offices cannot run smoothly as they were
                    running before, thus majority of the companies are opting
                    Work from Home (‘WFH’) as a better option to not completely
                    shut down economy flow.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-2">
                    Due to lockdown across the globe, 70 per cent of the office
                    goers are regularly working from the home. Even though, some
                    companies are looking for WFH as a permanent option for
                    their employees, for instance Tata Consultancy Services
                    (TCS) has recently announced that 75 per cent of the total
                    workforce will work from home permanently by 2025.

                  <p className="mt-2">
                    However, there are some drawbacks of the WFH for employees
                    and employer. Being isolated in the home, and doing work
                    simultaneously is challenging for employees, hence, the
                    companies are trying to get hold of the balance between
                    keeping employees motivated and maintaining a healthy office
                    environment that can improve work productivity.
