                  Statement of working needs to be submitted for all patents in
                  force under Section 146(2) of the Indian Patent Act and under
                  rule 131. These statements are required to be filed on an
                  annual basis with respect to all the granted patents in India.
                  These statements of working disclose the extent to which the
                  patented invented has been worked on the commercial scale. The
                  timeline for filing of the working statement is March 31st of
                  every year for each preceding calendar year. This statement is
                  submitted by filing prescribed Form-27 each year within 3
                  months from the end of the calendar year. This form can be
                  filed online by either the patentee or the licensee, or by a
                  patent agent/ attorney who has the address of service in
                  India. In case, the patentee or licensee is residing outside
                  India, he must contact an Indian patent agent/ attorney for
                  submitting this form at the IPO.

                <p className="mt-2">
                  The controller at any time can also ask the patentee or the
                  licensee to submit details in writing as to what extent of
                  commercialization in respect of the patent has been exploited
                  in India, as per Section 146(1).

                  The information disclosed in the statement of working is used
                  while taking decisions on granting a compulsory license.
                  Therefore, legal provisions relating to compulsory licenses
                  and working of patent are interlinked. IPAB (Intellectual
                  Property Appellate Board), India, also took into consideration
                  the same information disclosed in the statement of working by
                  the patentee at the time of granting the first compulsory
                  license in India. IPAB took a landmark decision in “Bayer
                  Corporation v. Natco Pharma Ltd” case where compulsory license
                  was granted to Natco.

                  licensee can be punished with a fine, which can be extended up
                  to Ten lakh rupees under Section 122(1)(b). Further, providing
                  wrongful information or statement can impose imprisonment up

                  Working or non-working of a patent becomes an important factor
                  while considering infringement suits. In suits relating to
                  infringement under section 108 of Indian Patent Act, the
                  patentee, can claim damages and injunction and/or an account
                  of profit as relief. The disclosed information in the
                  statement of working can be used by the court to estimate the
                  actual damages that may have been claimed. On the other hand,
                  if statement of working is not filed, the alleged infringer
                  may argue that the patentee might not have encountered any
                  damages in view of not filing any statement of working.

                  The statement of working provides useful insights into
                  effectiveness of the patenting system for various companies,
                  industries and other business bodies which utilize the
                  patented invention in their course of business. The IPO made
                  all working statements publicly available online, filed by the
                  patentee during the preceding year. Section 146(3) clearly
                  mentions power of Controller to publish the information
                  received by the IPO under section 146(1) and (2). Such type of
                  publication of valuable information shows the effectiveness of
                  patenting system in India and can be utilized in many forums
                  like academicians, law-makers and potential licensees to amend
                  or improve the Indian patent law. It also helps to evaluate
                  the patents covered under these published working statements.

                  Publication of statement of working encourages development in
                  the science and technology domain. Beside this, it also has
                  business and trade advantages. Working statements pertaining
                  to a patent help in evaluating the value of a patent and thus
                  help a potential licensee to negotiate the fee for getting the
                  license which would be based on the value of a particular
                  patent. Moreover, a working statement is also important in
                  proving a milestone from the business merger or a business
                  takeover perspective. Furthermore, industries may customize
                  their resources occupied in research and development which
                  would be according to the prospering technology relating to
                  their field based on the information extracted from available
                  working statements. Thus, the information we acquire from
                  working of inventions gives an excellent idea about the
                  commercial viability of inventions, effectiveness of
                  inventions and plays an important role in valuation of patent
                  portfolios and compulsory licensing.

                    Submitting information regarding working of patent is
                    becoming a peculiar requirement under Indian patent law.
                    Patents are granted to encourage invention, innovation,
                    research and technology and to ensure that the invention,
                    for which the patent has been filed, is being commercialized
                    for the benefit of the public. Filing of statement of
                    working discloses periodic information to the Indian patent
                    office regarding Commercialization of the patented invention
                    in Indian Jurisdiction thereby preventing the
                    non-commercialization/ non- use or misuse of patented
                    inventions. It does appear that the information from
                    relevant form helps to evaluate critical information for
                    compulsory licensing, also this information is important in
                    the industry, and helps in taking business decisions.
                    Therefore, the filing of Form 27 for all granted patents is
                    a statutory requirement which is required to be followed and
                    the Indian patent office should enforce action strictly
                    against those people who are violating the Indian patent
                    law.
