                  Once a trademark application is filed at Trademark Registry,
                  it is examined by the Trademark Registrar with respect to
                  distinctiveness of an applied mark. If the Trademark Registrar
                  gets satisfied about the distinct nature of the applied mark
                  and feels that there are no existing similar mark(s) in the
                  register of Trademarks, then the applied mark is published
                  into the Trademark Journal.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 text-justify">
                  The published Trademark is opened for public
                  inspection/opposition by third parties for a period of 04
                  months. In matters where no opposition is filed during this
                  period, the mark gets registered. In another situation, where
                  oppositions are filed, then the opposition proceedings are
                  initiated and decision of the applied mark depends upon on the
                  outcome of the opposition proceedings at the Trademark
                  Registry.

                    Under Section 21 of Trade Mark Act, “Any person” who is
                    having thinking that his/ her brand name/logo or reputation
                    of a company could be damaged if the trademark application
                    gets registered. He / She could opt to oppose such
                    registration by filing a Notice of Opposition by prescribed
                    form along with requisite fee.

                    There is no restriction on who may file an opposition.
                    Anyone who is having an opinion that the published trademark
                    application may create confusion among the public as having
                    similar goods, may file for the opposition and wait for
                    further trademark proceedings.

                    The opponent does not mandatorily have to be a registered
                    proprietor of a trademark. He / She could be either a
                    purchaser, customer or a member of the public likely to use
                    the similar goods. The logic behind this opposition
                    provision is that the opponent is not only representing
                    himself / herself but also represents public because having
                    two similar marks in the market dealing with same goods may
                    result unnecessary confusion amongst the public.
