							  Patent Drafting is the first and perhaps the most important step during the entire lifecycle of the patent. No matter how good an invention is, a poorly drafted patent can lead to the loss of rightful return on investment. A poorly drafted patent may have loopholes which a potential infringer may utilize in order to get away with infringement, or worse an assignee may lose the rights at a later stage in case the patent has issues like improper enablement, improper explanation of invention etc. A good patent draft not only includes proper enablement of the invention, but also includes all the possible embodiments of the invention. At times, inventors are not able to envision all the possible embodiments of their invention, a good patent drafter therefore, works closely with the inventors in order to protect the broadest possible scope of the invention using the claims.
</p> <p class="py-6 w-full leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
Good drafting practices also suggest keeping in mind the prosecution of the patent, a good patent drafter drafts the specification so that necessary amendments, which need to be made during the prosecution, are also well supported.
