                Patent filing in India is an elaborate and complex process, in which an applicant / inventor may waste a good amount of time if not well assisted by professionals who have expertise in patent filing. Incorrectly filled up forms may lead to loss of the priority right and / or may delay the priority date. Even after filing of the patent, there are other documents that need to be filed within prescribed timelines, such as a request for examination. Missing of deadline for such timely filings may lead to deemed withdrawal of the patent and render the time and money invested as waste.
