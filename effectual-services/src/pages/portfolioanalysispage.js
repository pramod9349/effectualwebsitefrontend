              In the past few decades, the pace of technological advances has resulted in a growing vogue of products and services, which creates new market. The foremost purpose of portfolio analysis in funding portfolio administration is to supply a caution direction to the risk and return of an investor on portfolio.

Organizations invest a lot of capital in patent applications, research, and development. Analyses of patent portfolios serve as the cornerstone of a watchful and long-term business growth plan. We may assist our clients in analyzing their patent portfolios or the patent portfolios of their key competitors in order to find opportunities and vulnerabilities within those portfolios. The portfolio analysis is performed to determine the strength of each patent in the portfolio and, if necessary, to determine which patents in the portfolio are possibly infringed by currently available products. 
Patent Portfolio Analysis is carried out to learn about the patents owned with the aid of a company. This enterprise can be one’s own company or a competitor organization. IP Portfolio means a set of all current or future patents, all rights, identify and interest in and to application fashions and innovations (whether patentable or no longer patentable), copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and techniques, enterprise names, domains, designs and technology.
 <br></br><br></br>
Our team of domain experts at Effectual Services performs an in-depth analysis of patents and provides with a detailed exhaustive report. We provide portfolio management and targeted infringement search for maximum monetization. Our team analyzes and/or mines IP portfolios for our clients, identifies target markets and competitors, and scrutinizes competitors' product portfolios.
<br></br><br></br>
We provide the deliverables as Portfolio Analysis report. A Portfolio Analysis report includes infringement feasibility reports and EoU (claim charts). A feasibility report includes infringement probability of a product or service along with a detailed summary of the analysis. Further, the EoU (claim charts) include detailed mapping of the product features against the patent claims with proper comments.  Infringement probability of a product or service along with a detailed summary of the analysis. The turnaround time for a Portfolio Analysis report is 32-40 hours. The turnaround time could be extended if we are provided with border scope (more set of patent).

  <p class ="mb-4">One of our client, from telecommunication domain, requested us to help monetize their IP portfolio of large size against their key competitors.<br></br> <br></br> 
As a first step, we run the provided Patents from our client portfolio through our in-house ranking tool in order to determine their patent strength. Our ranking tool is designed to determine the value of a patent based on few key parameters (including but not limiting), Citations, Priority date, Expected expiry date, Family members, Claims, Prosecution history, etc. The proprietary algorithm of the tool assigns different weights to the key parameters based upon one’s business context and assesses the strength of each patent accordingly. For example, we will perform for all 1600 patents to pick the top 100 patents in addition to the objective parameter.<br></br> <br></br> 
Once the portfolio used to be ranked primarily based on the key parameters, as a next step, is to perform quick and effective analysis based totally on the breadth/scope of claims and the ease of infringement indication and classify each patent in one of H/M/L category.<br></br> <br></br> 
Further, assigning every patent “Detectability”, “Claim Strength and “Business Impact” ranking on the basis Title, Abstract and Claims. The HML analysis will be based on one patent per family. High, Medium and Low ranking will be assigned to every family (based on representing family member). We will provide the categorized ranking of 100 patents and will select top 20 patents (firstly H, then M category and subsequently L category) based on the analysis to be taken forward.<br></br> <br></br> 
The next task is to perform a product search for the patents ranked as High or Medium (for the Top 20 patents). A feasibility report (in a word format) will be generated for each patent that will include details about identified product(s).<br></br> <br></br> 
Finally, we select High ranked patents based on the extent of overlap with the target product and proceed with 2-pager EoU charts. An EoU chart (claim chart) charts include detailed mapping of the product features against the patent claims with proper comments. Using this approach, we were able to identify a good number of potential infringing products from the vast and varying product portfolio of competitors and later we prepared claim charts for nearly 30% of the granted assets of our client. For the remaining 70% assets, we prepared feasibility reports describing our detailed technical findings in brief.<br></br> <br></br> 
The client was highly impressed by our output, and as a result we are still continuing to extend our services and support to fulfill their monetization and other IP business needs.
