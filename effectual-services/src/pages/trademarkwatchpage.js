                              What happens after a trademark is filed? What happens after a trademark is registered? Can we sit relaxed once USPTO registers my mark? Is it only Examiner’s job to look out for conflicting marks? These questions come across every applicant’s/assignee’s mind once they file a mark. To overcome this feeling of uncertainty we go for a trademark watch service depending upon the importance of that mark in our corporate profile. The world of IP can be difficult because of its abstract nature and combination of different types of rights. The image of your business is a key to your success and recognition and thus contributes to a major part of your profits. What if a new upcoming brand starts using McDonald’s famous phrase mark I’m Lovin’ It or your logo gets copied and a look alike is running in the market. How to control this?
							  </p><p>Trademark Watch Service is an important process that helps companies to identify trademark infringement in a timely manner.  The trademark watch service monitors trademarks that are registered or in the mid of the registration process to check for any potential infringement. It allows trademark owners to get alerts when the filing of a similar trademark takes place. If the company finds any mark resembling or violating the right of the original Trademark, it can file an application against the infringing party. The owner has the right to present the opposition actions against the application, aiming to prevent its registration.</p>

Not many of us are aware but Amazon had to face an infringement from a company called Prime Inc for using “Prime” on trucks to advertise. This began when Amazon started using the term “prime” on its trucks which made the trucking company Prime Inc sue the e-commerce company. Amazon created its “prime” service in 2015, but it began to use it on its trucks a few years later even though Prime Inc has been using it for nearly 40 years. Amazon had to change the “prime” original logo using a lowercase letter and a different font.
